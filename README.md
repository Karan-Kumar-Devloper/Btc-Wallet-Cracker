# Btc-Wallet-Cracker

Welcome to the **Btc-Wallet-Cracker** repository. This project provides a tool for Bitcoin wallet cracking.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Installation Guide for Linux

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Karan-Kumar-Devloper/Btc-Wallet-Cracker.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Btc-Wallet-Cracker
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory to store configuration settings. This file will be used to securely store sensitive information such as API keys and chat IDs.

Hereâ€™s an example `.env` file:

```
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_api_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
```

Replace `your_telegram_api_token` and `your_telegram_chat_id` with your actual Telegram API token and chat ID. Ensure this `.env` file is not shared publicly and is added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing it to version control.

### 3. Run the `setup.sh` Script

The `setup.sh` script automates the installation of necessary dependencies and sets up the environment.

1. **Ensure the script is executable**:

   ```sh
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script**:

   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## `setup.sh` Script Overview

The `setup.sh` script performs the following tasks:

1. **Checks if Python and pip are installed**. If not, it installs them.
2. **Updates pip** to the latest version.
3. **Installs required Python modules**: `colorama`, `mnemonic`, `bip32utils`, `ecdsa`, `python-telegram-bot`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `faker`, and `httpx`.
4. **Runs the provided Python script** (`btc-wallet-cracker.py`).
5. **Prints developer and organization information**.

### Notes

- Ensure `setup.sh` and any required Python scripts are in the same directory.
- Replace `btc-wallet-cracker.py` in the `setup.sh` script with the name of the actual Python script you want to run.
